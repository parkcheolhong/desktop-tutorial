# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow checks out code, builds an image, performs a container image
# vulnerability scan with Anchore's Grype tool, and integrates the results with GitHub Advanced Security
# code scanning feature.  For more information on the Anchore scan action usage
# and parameters, see https://github.com/anchore/scan-action. For more
# information on Anchore's container image scanning tool Grype, see

name: Upload a Build Artifact

  with:
    # Artifact name
    name: # optional, default is artifact
    # A file, directory or wildcard pattern that describes what to upload
    path: 
    # The desired behavior if no files are found using the provided path.
Available Options:
  warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
  error: Fail the action with an error message
  ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail

    if-no-files-found: # optional, default is warn
    # Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.
Minimum 1 day. Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.

    retention-days: # optional
    # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.

    compression-level: # optional, default is 6
    # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded. If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists. Does not fail if the artifact does not exist.

    overwrite: # optional, default is false
    # If true, hidden files will be included in the artifact. If false, hidden files will be excluded from the artifact.

    include-hidden-files: # optional, default is false
